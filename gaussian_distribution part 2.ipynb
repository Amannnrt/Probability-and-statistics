    "# Multivariate Normal (Gaussian) Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The multivariate normal distribution is one of the most important distributions in probability and statistics, with numerous applications in machine learning, signal processing, finance, and more. Below, we discuss the key properties of the multivariate normal distribution.\n",

    "A random vector \\( \\mathbf{X} = [X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_d]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^d \\) follows a multivariate normal distribution if its probability density function (PDF) is given by:\n",

    "## 7. Uncorrelated Implies Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "In a multivariate Gaussian distribution, uncorrelated variables are also independent. This is a special property of the Gaussian distribution and does not hold for general distributions.\n",

    "\n",
    "The quadratic form \\( (\\mathbf{x} - \\boldsymbol{\\mu})^T \\Sigma^{-1} (\\mathbf{x} - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}) \\) appears in the exponent of the PDF. This term represents the squared Mahalanobis distance between \\( \\mathbf{x} \\) and \\( \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\), accounting for the shape of the distribution via the covariance matrix \\( \\Sigma \\).\n",

    "## 9. Level Sets (Contours)\n",
    "\n",
    "The level sets of the multivariate Gaussian PDF are ellipsoids centered at \\( \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\). These ellipsoids are determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\( \\Sigma \\):\n",

    "The differential entropy of a multivariate Gaussian distribution is:\n",

    "H(\\mathbf{X}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\log\\left((2 \\pi e)^d |\\Sigma|\\right).\n",

    "## 11. Maximum Entropy Property\n",
    "\n",
    "Among all distributions with a fixed mean vector \\( \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\) and covariance matrix \\( \\Sigma \\), the multivariate Gaussian distribution has the maximum entropy. This makes it the \"least informative\" distribution consistent with the given constraints.\n",

    "## 13. Degenerate Case\n",
    "\n",
    "If the covariance matrix \\( \\Sigma \\) is singular (not positive definite), the distribution is degenerate, meaning it lies in a lower-dimensional subspace of \\( \\mathbb{R}^d \\). In this case, the PDF is not well-defined, but the distribution can still be described using generalized inverses.\n",

    "\n",
    "To sample from \\( \\mathbf{X} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\Sigma) \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the Cholesky decomposition of \\( \\Sigma \\): \\( \\Sigma = L L^T \\), where \\( L \\) is a lower triangular matrix.\n",
    "2. Generate \\( \\mathbf{z} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I) \\), a standard normal vector.\n",
    "3. Compute \\( \\mathbf{x} = \\boldsymbol{\\mu} + L \\mathbf{z} \\).\n",
