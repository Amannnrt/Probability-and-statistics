# Probability and Statistics for Machine Learning  

Welcome to my **Probability and Statistics** repository! This is a dedicated space where I document my learning journey through the fascinating world of probability, statistics, and their applications in machine learning. Whether you're a beginner exploring these topics or an experienced practitioner seeking concise explanations, this repository aims to provide valuable insights, organized notes, and practical resources.

## üìö Overview  

This repository is structured around my personal exploration of key concepts in **probability theory**, **statistical inference**, and their relevance to machine learning. I am primarily following the classic book *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* by **Christopher M. Bishop**, which offers a comprehensive theoretical foundation for these topics. To enhance my understanding, I also incorporate intuitive explanations from popular educators like *StatQuest with Josh Starmer* on YouTube.
